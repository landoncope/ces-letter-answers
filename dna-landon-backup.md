# DNA

**The claim:**

> "DNA analysis has concluded that Native American Indians do not originate from the Middle East or from Israelites but rather from Asia. Why did the Church change the following section of the introduction page in the 2006 edition Book of Mormon, shortly after the DNA results were released?"[^CLDNA]

The CES Letter presents a before/after comparison of the Book of Mormon introduction:

> *"...the Lamanites, and they are **the principal** ancestors of the American Indians"*

changed to:

> *"...the Lamanites, and they are **among the** ancestors of the American Indians"*

An "UPDATE" adds: "The Church conceded in its January 2014 *Book of Mormon and DNA Studies* essay that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA."[^CLDNA]

In 2016, geneticists sequenced 84 ancient South American haplotypes from pre-Columbian remains. Every single one was extinct in modern populations. Zero survived.[^Llamas] If you want to know what DNA actually tells us about ancient America, start there.

**The CES Letter skips the question that matters: what would population genetics actually predict if a small Israelite family arrived in the Americas 2,600 years ago?**

## Native Americans carry Asian DNA. Nobody disputes that.

Native Americans carry five major mitochondrial DNA haplogroups: A2, B2, C1, D1, and X2a. Y-chromosome haplogroups are predominantly C and Q. All trace to northeast Asian source populations arriving via Beringia during the last Ice Age.[^GospelTopicsEssay]

No serious Latter-day Saint scholar disputes this. The Church's own 2014 Gospel Topics Essay acknowledges that "the evidence assembled to date suggests that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA."[^GospelTopicsEssay]

The CES Letter treats this as the end of the conversation. Population genetics says it's the beginning.

---

## What the CES Letter doesn't tell you about DNA

The CES Letter invokes "DNA analysis" as a monolithic authority — "has concluded" — without citing a single genetic study, a single population geneticist, or a single peer-reviewed article.[^CLDNA]

The actual science looks nothing like "case closed."

### You can't find what you can't define

The most basic problem: no one knows what Lehi's DNA looked like.

That sounds like a dodge. It isn't.

Ugo Perego — a population geneticist who has spent his career studying Native American DNA — discovered through his own testing that he carries Y-chromosome haplogroup C. East Asian lineage. He's Italian. Roughly 100% European autosomal DNA. If his remains were excavated in 2,000 years, Y-chromosome analysis would classify him as "Asian origin."[^PeregoMaternal]

| What the test says | What's actually true |
| --- | --- |
| Perego's Y-chromosome haplogroup: C (East Asian) | He's Italian with ~100% European autosomal DNA |
| A single marker tells one story | The full genome tells another |

The Middle East in 600 BC was a genetic crossroads. Haplogroups common there today (J, E, G for Y-chromosome; H, V, J, K, T, U for mtDNA) may not represent what was common 2,600 years ago. Lehi's family — from the tribe of Manasseh — might have carried markers that look nothing like modern Jewish or Middle Eastern populations.[^PeregoMaternal]

As Perego put it: "Without our knowing the genetic signature to be located, any attempt at researching it will unavoidably result in further assumptions and untestable hypotheses."[^PeregoMaternal]

### A family of 30 walks into a continent of millions

Lehi's party numbered perhaps 20–30 people. The Mulekites were similarly small.

When a small group enters territory already populated by tens of millions, their genetic contribution is negligible from day one.[^EkinsPerego] This isn't speculation. It's genetic swamping — one of the most well-established phenomena in population genetics.

| Factor | Implication |
| --- | --- |
| Lehi's party: ~30 people | Vanishingly small genetic contribution to a populated continent |
| Americas population ~600 BC: tens of millions[^Denevan] | Host population DNA dominates within generations |
| mtDNA traces only one line per generation | After 10 generations, detects 1 of 1,024 ancestors |
| Y-chromosome traces only one line | Same limitation on the paternal side |

Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA each trace a single ancestral line — your mother's mother's mother, or your father's father's father. After just 10 generations, these markers detect only 2 of your 1,024 ancestors at that depth. The vast majority of your ancestry is invisible to uniparental tests.[^EkinsPerego]

### The Iceland problem

Even if Lehi's family initially carried distinctive markers, genetic drift — the random loss of genetic variants over generations — erodes them over time. How fast?

Helgason et al. (2009) answered that question using Iceland. They analyzed 68 mtDNA sequences from Iceland's founding settlers, approximately 1,100 years ago, and compared them to modern Icelanders.[^HelgasonIceland]

The finding: the ancient haplotypes were "more closely related to sequences from present inhabitants of Scotland, Ireland and Scandinavia than to those from their descendants, the modern Icelandic population."[^HelgasonIceland]

In just 1,100 years, in a well-documented, literate population with continuous habitation on an isolated island, genetic drift had substantially reshaped the mtDNA pool.

Iceland had a known founding population, written records, and no catastrophic population collapse. Now consider what happens over 2,600 years in the Americas — with multiple bottleneck events along the way.

### The catastrophe that rewrote everything

European contact didn't just reduce Native American populations. It obliterated them.

Estimates for pre-contact population range widely — Denevan estimated roughly 54 million, while other scholars have proposed figures from 40 to over 100 million.[^Denevan][^Koch] Post-contact lows reached single-digit millions — a 90% or greater collapse.[^Koch] Michael Crawford, a molecular anthropologist at the University of Kansas, described the effect: "The Conquest and its sequelae squeezed the entire Amerindian population through a genetic bottleneck. The reduction of Amerindian gene pools from 1/3 to 1/25 of their previous size implies a considerable loss of genetic variability."[^Crawford]

And all of this happened *after* the Book of Mormon's own internal catastrophes: citywide destruction at Christ's crucifixion (3 Nephi 8), total warfare in the fourth century AD, and the extinction of the Jaredite civilization.

### 84 ancient lineages — all extinct

The most devastating evidence came in 2016. Llamas et al. sequenced 92 complete mitochondrial genomes from pre-Columbian South American skeletons dating from 8,600 to 500 years old. They identified 84 distinct haplotypes — individual sequences within the major haplogroup families.[^Llamas]

Then they checked modern databases.

> "None of the 84 haplotypes identified from ancient samples are represented in the existing genealogy of global human mitochondrial diversity."[^Llamas]

Zero. Not one of the 84 ancient sequences survived in modern populations. European colonization caused "local mass mortality and extinction of lineages associated with major population centers."[^Llamas]

An important distinction: the five major Native American haplogroup *families* (A, B, C, D, X) survived the bottleneck. What was lost were individual lineages *within* those families. The founding haplogroup types persisted because they were carried by millions of people across an entire hemisphere. A hypothetical Israelite lineage — carried by a few dozen people in a limited area — would have been far more vulnerable to extinction than the continent-spanning haplogroup families that survived.

> **Bottom line:** Entire pre-Columbian lineages vanished from modern DNA. In a hemisphere that lost 90% of its population after European contact, the absence of any specific ancient lineage is the expected outcome — not an anomaly.

---

## Whole civilizations disappeared without a genetic trace

The Llamas study is not an outlier. The pattern repeats across the Americas.

| Study | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| **Llamas et al. 2016** | All 84 pre-Columbian South American mtDNA haplotypes extinct in modern populations[^Llamas] |
| **Fernandes et al. 2021** | Original Caribbean inhabitants largely replaced by later migration waves ~1,700 years ago[^Fernandes] |
| **Krkert et al. 2025** | Previously unknown hunter-gatherer lineage near Bogota, genetically distinct from other known ancient American populations, disappeared from the record over roughly 4,000 years[^Bogota] |
| **Willerslev & Meltzer 2021** | Americas populated by "distinct and previously unknown populations, including some for whom there are no currently known descendants"[^WillerslevMeltzer] |
| **Rasmussen et al. 2010** | 4,000-year-old Paleo-Eskimo from Greenland — DNA closely related to Siberian Far East populations, not to Inuit or other Native Americans. No modern descendants[^Rasmussen] |

Entire civilizations existed, flourished, and left zero detectable genetic trace in modern populations. This is not a theoretical possibility. It is the documented norm.

As Perego observed about the Saqqaq individual: "The lack of genetic continuity between the ancient Saqqaq individual and the modern population of the New World Arctic stands as a witness that other migrations that left no contemporary descendants could have taken place."[^PeregoMaternal]

> **Bottom line:** The genetic record of the Americas is a graveyard of vanished lineages. The question is not whether ancient populations can disappear from modern DNA — they routinely do.

## The "exclusively Asian" story keeps breaking

The simple narrative — "Native Americans are 100% Asian, case closed" — keeps breaking.

### Western Eurasian ancestry is real — but ancient

In 2014, Raghavan et al. sequenced the genome of a 24,000-year-old individual from the Mal'ta site in Siberia. The finding: **14 to 38% of Native American ancestry** may derive from an ancient population closely related to modern Western Eurasians.[^Raghavan]

This ancestry entered the Americas via Siberia during the Upper Paleolithic — roughly 20,000 years before the Book of Mormon's timeline. It does not evidence a 600 BC Israelite migration. But it demolishes the premise that Native American DNA is exclusively East Asian.

### Pre-Columbian transoceanic contact is confirmed

In 2020, Ioannidis et al. published in *Nature* the first conclusive genetic evidence for prehistoric contact between Polynesians and South Americans around AD 1200 — before the settlement of Easter Island.[^Ioannidis] Ancient peoples crossed thousands of miles of open ocean and left detectable genetic traces.

This happened roughly 1,800 years *after* the Book of Mormon's proposed timeline. The additional drift between Lehi's era and the Polynesian contact event illustrates how much more difficult it would be to detect a 600 BC signal today.

### Population Y — ancestry nobody predicted

In 2015, Skoglund et al. discovered that certain Amazonian groups carry approximately 2% ancestry from a population more closely related to indigenous Australasians than to any other present-day group. David Reich, the Harvard geneticist behind the finding, told journalists: "We spent a really long time trying to make this result go away and it just got stronger."[^Skoglund][^ReichQuote]

| Study | Finding | Time depth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Raghavan et al. 2014** | 14–38% Western Eurasian ancestry in Native Americans | ~24,000 years ago |
| **Ioannidis et al. 2020** | Pre-Columbian Polynesian-South American contact | ~AD 1200 |
| **Skoglund et al. 2015** | ~2% Australasian ancestry in Amazonian groups | Deep prehistory |

Nobody predicted Australasian ancestry in the Amazon. Nobody predicted Polynesian-South American contact. Nobody predicted that every single pre-Columbian South American mtDNA haplotype would be extinct in modern populations. The "case closed" posture does not age well.

---

## Haplogroup X: an argument to avoid

Some Latter-day Saint commentators, particularly advocates of the "Heartland" model, have pointed to mitochondrial haplogroup X2a as evidence for the Book of Mormon. X2a is found in some North American populations and also appears in parts of the Near East and Europe. The argument: X2a represents Lehite DNA.

The scientific consensus has rejected this.[^RaffBolnick] X2a entered the Americas at least 15,000 years ago — consistent with arrival via Beringia alongside other founding lineages, not with a separate transoceanic route.

Responsible Latter-day Saint geneticists, including Perego, have said as much.[^PeregoMaternal] Claiming X2a as evidence is the kind of argument that damages credibility when it fails — and it has failed.

---

## What about autosomal DNA?

Everything above focuses on mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA — uniparental markers that each trace a single ancestral line. A skeptic familiar with modern genetics will point out that these are no longer the cutting edge.

Autosomal DNA analyzes hundreds of thousands of markers across all ancestral lines simultaneously. It overcomes the "1 of 1,024" limitation of uniparental markers. And genome-wide studies of pre-Columbian ancient DNA — including major studies by Posth et al. (2018) and Moreno-Mayar et al. (2018) — show no Middle Eastern ancestry in any pre-Columbian sample tested to date.[^MorenoMayar]

This is the strongest form of the DNA argument, and it deserves a direct answer.

### What autosomal DNA can and cannot do

Autosomal DNA is powerful but not omniscient. Three limitations matter here.

**The reference problem persists.** Autosomal ancestry assignments depend on reference panels — databases of known populations used to classify ancient genomes. These panels are built from *modern* populations. If Lehi's DNA profile does not match modern Middle Eastern reference panels (and it may not — see the "crossroads" problem above), autosomal analysis would classify his ancestry as something else entirely.[^PeregoMaternal]

**Sample geography is uneven.** The major ancient DNA studies have sequenced individuals from across the Americas, but coverage remains sparse for the specific regions proposed as Book of Mormon settings (southern Mexico, Guatemala, highland South America). An absence of Middle Eastern signal in samples from Alaska, Patagonia, or the Great Plains does not rule out a localized contribution elsewhere.[^MorenoMayar]

**Small contributions wash out.** If Lehi's group was genetically swamped within a few generations — as the founder effect predicts — then by the time their descendants numbered in the thousands, the autosomal contribution from the original ~30 migrants would be diluted below detection thresholds, falling below the noise floor of most ancestry analyses.[^EkinsPerego]

### The honest assessment

Autosomal DNA does narrow the window. It makes a *large-scale* Israelite genetic contribution to the Americas extremely unlikely. Any Lehite genetic signal, if it ever existed, was small — and that is consistent with the "others" model, which holds that Lehite influence was cultural and religious rather than primarily genetic.

The autosomal evidence does not prove the Book of Mormon false. But it does mean that anyone looking for Middle Eastern DNA as confirmation of the Book of Mormon is almost certainly looking in vain.

---

## The Book of Mormon never claimed what the CES Letter says it claimed

The DNA argument draws its force from a specific assumption: that the Book of Mormon claims Lehi's family were the sole or principal ancestors of all Native Americans.

The Book of Mormon text makes no such claim. For more on the Book of Mormon's [internal geography](/book-of-mormon/geography) and how it describes a limited setting, see the geography article.

### Textual evidence for "others"

When scholars read the Book of Mormon carefully, they find abundant evidence that Lehi's group encountered pre-existing populations:

- **Impossible demographics.** Within a single generation, Nephi describes building a temple, waging wars, and sustaining an agricultural economy. That's demographically impossible from 30 people without absorbing local populations.[^SorensonOthers]

- **Sherem.** Jacob 7 introduces a man who "came among the people of Nephi" and had "a perfect knowledge of the language of the people." The phrasing signals an outsider.[^SorensonOthers]

- **Mulekite language corruption.** When discovered by Nephites, the Mulekites' language had "become corrupted" (Omni 1:17) — consistent with linguistic mixing with non-Hebrew speakers.[^SorensonOthers]

- **"Lamanite" as identity, not genetics.** By 4 Nephi, the terms are explicitly social categories: "there began to be Lamanites again in the land" describes people *choosing* an identity, not inheriting bloodlines.[^Gardner]

John Sorenson published "When Lehi's Party Arrived in the Land, Did They Find Others There?" in 1992, identifying these and other textual indicators decades before DNA became an issue.[^SorensonOthers]

### The introduction is not scripture

The 1981 introduction stating Lamanites were "the principal ancestors of the American Indians" was a study aid — not scripture, not revelation, not part of the translated text. It was composed by the Scriptures Publication Committee, which included Bruce R. McConkie, and is commonly attributed to him.[^GospelTopicsEssay][^GivensByHand]

The 2006 change to "among the ancestors" aligned the introduction with what the text actually says.

### This wasn't reactive

Critics sometimes claim the limited geography model was invented to dodge DNA evidence. The historical record says otherwise.

| Year | Development |
| --- | --- |
| **1929** | President Anthony W. Ivins (First Presidency): "The Book of Mormon...does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us that people did not come after."[^Ivins] |
| **1938** | LDS Department of Education Study Manual: "the Book of Mormon deals only with the history and expansion of three small colonies...it does not deny or disprove the possibility of other immigrations."[^RoperLimited] |
| **1985** | John Sorenson publishes *An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon*, arguing for limited geography and interaction with existing populations.[^SorensonSetting] |
| **1992** | Sorenson publishes textual evidence for "others" in the Book of Mormon.[^SorensonOthers] |
| **2003** | Murphy publishes first major DNA-based criticism of the Book of Mormon in *Dialogue*.[^Murphy] |
| **2004** | Southerton publishes *Losing a Lost Tribe*.[^Southerton] |

The "others" hypothesis and limited geography model were developed over 70 years before DNA criticism existed. They arose from reading the text, not from accommodating lab results.

> **Bottom line:** The limited geography model and "others" hypothesis were published decades before DNA criticism existed. They came from reading the text, not from defending against lab results.

## What about prophetic statements calling Native Americans "Lamanites"?

The limited geography and "others" model raises an obvious question: what about the many prophetic statements identifying specific Native Americans as descendants of Lehi?

D&C 28:8 refers to "the Lamanites" in connection with a mission to Native Americans near Missouri. D&C 32:2 and 54:8 use similar language. Spencer W. Kimball spoke of "about sixty million" Lamanites throughout the hemisphere. Gordon B. Hinckley referenced "descendants of Father Lehi" in temple dedications as recently as 1999.[^Kimball][^Hinckley]

These are not obscure statements. They represent a long tradition of hemispheric thinking in Church leadership.

### How the limited geography model accounts for this

The D&C passages call specific groups "Lamanites" — but the Book of Mormon itself uses "Lamanite" as a political and cultural category, not a genetic one. If Lehite language, culture, and religion spread across a much larger indigenous population, then the *cultural* descendants of Lamanites could number in the millions while the *genetic* contribution from the original family remains negligible.

This is not a novel reinterpretation. It follows from the text's own usage. By 4 Nephi 1:38, "Lamanite" designates people who chose an identity, and the term had already been applied to groups with no Lehite ancestry (Alma 3:10–11).

The prophetic statements reflect the understanding of their era — hemispheric, with Lehi's descendants populating the continent. Modern prophets have not repeated these claims in recent decades. The 2014 Gospel Topics Essay, published with First Presidency approval, explicitly adopts the limited geography framework.[^GospelTopicsEssay]

### An honest tension

This creates a genuine tension. If earlier prophets taught hemispheric ancestry as fact, and that teaching is now understood to be overstated, it raises questions about prophetic reliability on empirical matters.

The Church has navigated similar territory before — race and the priesthood, the age of the earth, the global flood. In each case, prophetic statements that reflected the scientific assumptions of their era were later qualified or set aside. This does not resolve the tension. It acknowledges it.

---

## Where the critics have a point

An honest treatment requires engaging the strongest version of the DNA criticism, not just the CES Letter's version.

### The Lemba comparison

The Lemba people of Zimbabwe migrated from Yemen approximately 1,000 years ago — a small group absorbed into a much larger African population. Despite being a tiny founding group swallowed by a vastly larger host, their Jewish Y-chromosome markers (the Cohen modal haplotype) remain detectable today.[^Thomas]

This is the single strongest counterpoint to the genetic drift defense.

| Factor | Lemba | Lehites (per Book of Mormon) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patrilineal marriage customs | Strict — specifically preserved Y-chromosome lineage | Not described in the text |
| Cultural isolation | Maintained as distinct endogamous group | Mixed into larger population; "Lamanite" became a political label |
| Time depth | ~1,000 years | ~2,600 years |
| Catastrophic bottleneck events | None documented | Multiple (3 Nephi 8, Jaredite extinction, European contact) |
| Population ratio (founders to hosts) | Small but with cultural practices preserving markers | ~30 people entering tens of millions |

The Lemba retained their markers because they practiced strict patrilineal endogamy — they married local women but passed the priestly lineage through males, generation after generation. The Book of Mormon describes no comparable practice. Instead, it describes Lehites mixing into a much larger population where identity markers were cultural, not genetic.[^EkinsPerego]

The Lemba example shows that lineage preservation *can* happen under specific conditions. The Iceland study and the Llamas study show that lineage loss happens under others. The question is which set of conditions better matches the Lehite scenario — and the answer, given the absence of described endogamy, the 2,600-year time depth, and the catastrophic bottlenecks, favors loss.

### The population scale problem

Thomas Murphy raised a legitimate tension: the Book of Mormon describes populations numbering "many thousands" in warfare, people who "multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the land" (Jarom 1:8), and civilizations that "covered the face of the whole earth" (Helaman 3:8). Genetic drift eliminates markers most effectively in small populations. If Lehite descendants truly numbered in the millions, their markers should be more resistant to drift.[^Murphy]

The large populations *are themselves the evidence for "others."* Thirty people do not produce armies of tens of thousands in a few centuries.

The Lehites' language, culture, and religion spread across a large population — but the genetics of that population were already overwhelmingly Asian. The Lehite contribution was cultural and religious, not primarily genetic. "Lamanite" and "Nephite" were political identities that encompassed millions of people who were not genetic descendants of Lehi.

But this answer creates its own tension. The Book of Mormon traces lineages: Nephi son of Lehi, Mosiah descended from Nephi, and so on through hundreds of years. The text presents these as biological lineages, not adopted political identities. The "others" model requires reading the genealogical claims as applying to a ruling elite within a much larger non-Lehite population — a reading that works historically (ruling minorities are common in ancient civilizations) but sits uncomfortably with the text's own framing.

This tension is real. It does not have a clean resolution.

### The unfalsifiability question

The philosophically sharpest critique: if we don't know Lehi's DNA, if genetic drift could erase any markers, if the population was small enough to disappear — then what evidence *could* disprove the Book of Mormon on genetic grounds?

The honest answer is that DNA evidence alone probably cannot resolve the Book of Mormon question either way. The Gospel Topics Essay says as much: "DNA studies cannot be used decisively to either affirm or reject the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon."[^GospelTopicsEssay]

That means the CES Letter's claim that "DNA analysis has concluded" the case against the Book of Mormon is overconfident. But it also means that defenders cannot point to DNA complexity as positive evidence for the Book of Mormon. You cannot cite genetic studies as supporting your case while simultaneously arguing that DNA cannot resolve the question.

The studies cited in this article — Western Eurasian ancestry via the Mal'ta boy, Polynesian-South American contact, Population Y — demonstrate that the genetic history of the Americas is more complex than the "100% Asian" narrative assumes. They do *not* demonstrate that a 600 BC Israelite migration occurred. They establish that confident declarations about what DNA has "concluded" about ancient American origins are premature — because the science keeps revising itself.

What *would* convince a fair-minded person that the Book of Mormon is genetically implausible? If ancient DNA from the specific proposed Book of Mormon lands consistently showed zero non-Asian admixture across hundreds of pre-Columbian samples — and if we could establish with confidence what Lehi's DNA looked like — that would be a serious blow. Neither condition has been met. The first is approaching but geographically incomplete. The second may never be met.

Many historical questions — Did a specific Phoenician ship reach Brazil? Did individual Roman soldiers trade along the Silk Road? — cannot be resolved by population genetics. The absence of detectable genetic evidence does not equal the absence of people.

---

## Genetic ancestry is not genealogical ancestry

Rohde, Olson, and Chang (2004) modeled that the most recent common ancestor of all living humans lived only a few thousand years ago. The "identical ancestors point" — where every person alive at that time is either an ancestor of everyone living today or has no living descendants at all — is surprisingly recent: roughly 5,000–15,000 years ago.[^Rohde]

Even if every trace of Lehi's DNA has been erased by drift, he could still be a genealogical ancestor of modern Native Americans. Your mtDNA traces to exactly one of your 1,024 ancestors at the ten-generation mark. The other 1,023 contributed to who you are without leaving a detectable genetic signature.

This argument is scientifically accurate — but it is also, by itself, trivially so. By the same logic, virtually everyone alive 3,000 years ago who has *any* living descendants is a genealogical ancestor of most living humans. The distinction matters for one reason: the CES Letter's claim that DNA has "concluded" Lehi's descendants don't exist conflates two different things. DNA tests show what markers you carry. They do not show who all your ancestors were.

---

## What population genetics actually predicts

The CES Letter presents DNA evidence as a simple binary: Israelite DNA or Asian DNA. Pick one.

Population genetics does not work that way. The question is whether a small Israelite family arriving in a populated continent 2,600 years ago would leave a detectable genetic signature today.

Based on everything we know about founder effects, genetic drift, population bottlenecks, and lineage extinction: no. Not because the family didn't exist — but because that's what happens to small founding populations over deep time.

The absence of detectable Lehite DNA is exactly what population genetics predicts — whether Lehi's family existed or not.

John Butler, a forensic DNA scientist who led the government's DNA identification efforts after 9/11, put it directly: no genetic study has been designed to test the Lehite hypothesis specifically, because the premises required for such a test — knowing the starting DNA, establishing an unbroken chain of genetic custody across 2,600 years — do not exist.[^Butler]

<YouTubeEmbed video-id="VghBVkyp1HU" title="DNA and the Book of Mormon" />

> **Bottom line:** The CES Letter says DNA has "concluded" the case against the Book of Mormon. Population genetics says ancient lineages routinely vanish — and this one was never identifiable in the first place.
