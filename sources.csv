Roberts (1904) responds to an Iowa attorney's objection about KJV language in the Book of Mormon.

Includes extensive verse-by-verse comparison tables (Isaiah/KJV/BOM and Matt 5–7 vs 3 Nephi 12–14 vs Douay Bible). Also argues Urim and Thummim translation was not mechanical but required exhausting intellectual and spiritual effort.
