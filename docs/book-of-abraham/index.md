# Book of Abraham

The CES Letter calls this section its strongest case:

> "It is the smoking gun that has completely obliterated my testimony of Joseph Smith and his claims."[^CLSmokingGun]

The argument: Joseph Smith said he translated the Book of Abraham from Egyptian papyri. We now have some of those papyri. Egyptologists say they're ordinary funerary documents — a Breathing Permit for a man named Hor. Therefore Joseph fabricated the whole thing.

That's the version designed to end the conversation. **How much of the evidence does it leave out?**

### The fraction that does the heavy lifting

The CES Letter never mentions how much of the original papyri collection survives.

The answer: roughly 2.5%.

Joseph's collection included multiple long scrolls — one eyewitness said a scroll "extended through two rooms of the Mansion House." The eleven fragments recovered in 1967 are small pieces mounted on paper, physically separated from the scrolls. John Gee's mathematical reconstruction — using Hoffmann's papyrus winding formula — estimates over 80 feet of material originally existed.[^GeePapyri]

The CES Letter treats these fragments as the entire source. That's like finding a few pages of an author's desk papers and declaring them the manuscript of a novel.

### Visual authority masking a weak foundation

Three side-by-side facsimile tables dominate the CES Letter's Book of Abraham section.[^CLFacsimiles] Twelve rows of mismatches between Joseph's identifications and modern Egyptological readings. The visual impression is devastating.

What's missing: the hits.

Joseph identified Facsimile 2, Figure 6 as "this earth in its four quarters." Egyptologists identify those four standing figures as the four sons of Horus — representing the four cardinal compass points. A perfect match the CES Letter's own table includes but never comments on.[^GeeFacsimileHits]

Kolob derives from Semitic *qlb* ("heart, center"). The name Shulem is attested in precisely two periods: Abraham's era and the Ptolemaic period. Abraham connected to a lion couch scene — Joseph's reading of Facsimile 1 — appears in Leiden Papyrus I 384, a third-century Egyptian document with Abraham's name written in Greek beneath the image.[^GeeFacsimileHits]

The CES Letter presents the misses without the matches. That's not analysis. It's curation.

### Century-old expert witnesses

The CES Letter stacks quotes from Egyptologists calling Joseph's work "ignorant" and "impudent fraud."[^CLEgyptologists] Every quote traces to one source: F.S. Spalding's 1912 book. These scholars were working over a century ago, before the papyri fragments were even rediscovered, and before modern study of hypocephali and ancient Abrahamic traditions had developed.

Since 1912, Figure 6 has been shown to match Joseph's explanation perfectly. Sacrifice themes in Facsimile 1 have been confirmed by archaeology. The astronomical and creation connections in Facsimile 2 align with what Egyptologists now know about hypocephali. "Not one single word that is true" is no longer defensible.

The Church acknowledged the funerary text identification in 1968 — in the *Improvement Era*, 45 years before the CES Letter.[^ImprovementEra] This isn't a concession forced by critics. It's been publicly known for over half a century.

### A fabrication that keeps passing tests

A 19th-century fabrication should contain zero elements confirmed by later discoveries. The Book of Abraham keeps being right about things Joseph Smith had no way of knowing.

Four deity names — Elkenah, Libnah, Mahmackrah, and Korash — all have ancient Near Eastern attestations discovered after Joseph's death. John Gee calculated the odds of randomly generating four correct ancient deity names at roughly 1 in 6.62 x 10^22.[^GeeDeityNames]

Abraham 1:10 names "the plains of Olishem." For nearly two centuries, critics dismissed it as invented. Then Akkadian texts surfaced containing *Ulisum* in northwestern Syria near Abraham's homeland — with standard Semitic sound correspondences. In 2013, Turkish excavators at Oylum Hoyuk identified the site. Cuneiform was not deciphered until after Joseph's death.[^Olishem]

Abraham 3's cosmology works outward from earth, ranks bodies by orbital period, and uses an "encircling = governing" framework that is distinctively Egyptian — not Newtonian. A 19th-century fabricator would have used the heliocentric model everyone around him accepted. The text even contains a pun — spirits (*akhw*) and circumpolar stars (*ikhmw-sk*) — that only works in Egyptian.[^AbrahamCosmology]

Over 100 ancient documents parallel the Book of Abraham's narratives — Abraham nearly sacrificed, idolatry in Ur, famine in Chaldea, astronomical teaching. The *Apocalypse of Abraham* wasn't available in English until 1919. The *Book of Jubilees* until 1902. The Dead Sea Scrolls until 1947.[^AncientParallels]

> **Bottom line:** The "smoking gun" depends on treating 2.5% of a papyri collection as the whole thing, hiding the facsimile details Joseph got right, and ignoring a growing catalog of ancient content confirmed by post-1835 discoveries. The Book of Abraham keeps passing tests it shouldn't pass if Joseph made it up.
