title: Other Concerns
description: The CES Letter's "Other Concerns" section pivots from truth claims to institutional complaints — transparency, finances, and anti-intellectualism. Most of these criticisms capture a snapshot of a church in transition and freeze it as a permanent indictment.

# Other Concerns

The CES Letter spends 111 pages attacking the Church's foundational truth claims. Then it pivots.

> "These concerns are secondary to all of the above. These concerns do not matter if the foundational truth claims (Book of Mormon, First Vision, Prophets, Book of Abraham, Witnesses, Priesthood, Temples, etc.) are not true."[^CLSecondary]

That's Runnells himself. A remarkable concession — and the correct framing. The "Other Concerns" section isn't about whether the Church is *true*. It's about whether the Church is *trustworthy*.

**So is the institution behaving the way you'd expect if it had something to hide?**

### A snapshot frozen as an indictment

The CES Letter captures real institutional growing pains — correlation-era manuals that oversimplified, financial opacity, a handful of disciplinary cases — and presents them as permanent features of a fundamentally dishonest organization.

But institutions change. The relevant question is trajectory.

Since the early 2000s, the Church has published the Joseph Smith Papers (27 volumes, National Archives standard), released 13 Gospel Topics Essays on its most sensitive historical topics, published *Saints* in four volumes openly discussing seer stones, polygamy, the priesthood ban, and Mountain Meadows, opened a public Church History Library, and released the first photograph of the seer stone in 2015.[^JSP][^GTE]

This is a coordinated, multi-decade, multi-million-dollar commitment to publishing difficult history under the Church's own name. Not a reluctant concession forced by critics. The CES Letter was written in 2013 — the same year this transparency revolution was accelerating.

### "Hidden history" that wasn't hidden

The seer stone translation method was described in the *Ensign* by Elder Russell M. Nelson in 1993. Richard Lloyd Anderson published on it in 1977. The *Friend* children's magazine mentioned it in 1974.[^NelsonEnsign][^AndersonSeerStone]

Multiple First Vision accounts were published in *BYU Studies* (1969), the *Improvement Era* (1970), and the *Ensign* (1985, 1996). Joseph Smith's polygamy was discussed in the *Improvement Era* in 1946.[^FirstVisionAccounts]

"The Church hid its history" often means "I didn't know about it." The gap between those two things is real — but it isn't institutional conspiracy.

### North Korea is not a serious comparison

The CES Letter builds to this:

> "Policies and practices you'd expect to find in a totalitarian system such as North Korea or George Orwell's 1984; not from the gospel of Jesus Christ."[^CLNorthKorea]

North Korea starves, imprisons, and executes its citizens. Comparing it to a voluntary religious organization — one you can leave at any time, one that operates four universities and funds dozens of scholarly journals — is not serious argumentation.

The CES Letter raises some legitimate institutional concerns. But it wraps them in rhetoric so overheated that it discredits the valid points alongside the invalid ones.

### An institution that builds, not buries

The anti-intellectualism charge runs headfirst into the Church's own institutional record. Four universities. BYU ranked in the top 110 nationally, third in the country for Fulbright Scholars. The Joseph Smith Papers published to National Archives standards. BYU Studies, the Maxwell Institute, the Interpreter Foundation, Scripture Central, Pearl of Great Price Central — all funded or supported by the Church's broader intellectual ecosystem.[^BYURankings]

Education among Latter-day Saints correlates with *higher* Church activity — the opposite of what you'd expect from an institution hostile to the life of the mind.[^PewEducation]

The September Six — the CES Letter's strongest anti-intellectualism evidence — involved six cases over thirty years. Avraham Gileadi was rebaptized in 1996. Maxine Hanks was rebaptized in 2012. Lavina Fielding Anderson's membership was restored posthumously in 2024. The Church now publishes openly the very findings that made some of these scholars controversial.[^SeptemberSix]

### What's fair

Some of these concerns are legitimate. Greater financial transparency would build trust. The Lorenzo Snow tithing quote alteration was a meaningful omission. The September Six had a real chilling effect on faithful scholarship for a generation.

Honest engagement means acknowledging what's fair while correcting what's misleading. Pretending every criticism is baseless would be as dishonest as pretending every criticism is valid.

> **Bottom line:** The CES Letter's "Other Concerns" are institutional complaints, not truth-claim arguments — and Runnells says so himself. The Church's trajectory since the early 2000s is unambiguously toward greater transparency, greater scholarly engagement, and greater honesty about its own difficult history. That trajectory matters more than a frozen snapshot.
