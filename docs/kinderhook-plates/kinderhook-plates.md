# Kinderhook Plates

**The claim:**

> "I insert fac-similes of the six brass plates found near Kinderhoook...I have translated a portion of them, and find they contain the history of the person with whom they were found. He was a descendant of Ham, through the loins of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and that he received his Kingdom from the Ruler of heaven and earth."[^CLKinderhook]

The CES Letter attributes this directly to "Joseph Smith, Jr." and then asks: "Not only did Joseph not discern the fraud, he added to the fraud by 'translating' the fake plates...What does this tell us about Joseph Smith's gift of translation?"[^CLKinderhook2]

**Who actually wrote those words -- and what did Joseph Smith really do with the plates?**

---

### The quote Joseph Smith never wrote

The passage the CES Letter attributes to Joseph Smith was not written by Joseph Smith.

It comes from William Clayton's personal journal, dated May 1, 1843. Clayton's original entry reads in the *third* person: "Prest J. has translated a portion and says they contain the history of the person with whom they were found."[^ClaytonJournal]

Decades later, compilers of the *History of the Church* converted Clayton's third-person note into first-person narrative -- standard nineteenth-century biographical practice.[^KimballEnsign] The result made it sound like Joseph himself sat down and wrote "I have translated a portion of them."

He didn't. That sentence is an editorial conversion of someone else's journal note.

---

### What Joseph Smith's own journal says

Joseph kept a journal. His entry from May 7, 1843:

> "forenoon visited by several gentlemen concerning the plates which were dug out of a mound near quncy [Quincy]"[^JSJournal]

That's it. No translation claim. No mention of Ham or Pharaoh. Just a note about visitors asking about some plates.

The Joseph Smith Papers editors concluded that "whatever JS initially thought about the plates, he soon lost interest in them."[^JSPEditorial]

### Four witnesses, four different stories

There are four eyewitness accounts from May 1843. They don't agree.

| Source | Date | What they reported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **William Clayton** (journal) | May 1, 1843 | "Prest J. has translated a portion" -- third-person clerk's note[^ClaytonJournal] |
| **Charlotte Haven** (letter) | May 2, 1843 | Joseph "thought that by the help of revelation he would be able to translate them" -- future tense, conditional[^HavenLetter] |
| **Parley P. Pratt** (letter) | May 7, 1843 | Plates brought "for examination & translation" -- stops short of confirming a translation occurred[^PrattLetter] |
| **Joseph Smith** (journal) | May 7, 1843 | Visited by gentlemen "concerning the plates" -- no translation claim at all[^JSJournal] |

Clayton says Joseph "has translated." Haven says he *thought he could*. Pratt mentions examination. Joseph's own journal says nothing about translating.

::: info Key Point
Charlotte Haven was not a Latter-day Saint. She was a non-Mormon visitor in Nauvoo writing to her family. Her account -- that Joseph said the characters looked *similar* to Book of Mormon writing and he *thought* he could translate them -- describes curiosity, not a completed translation.

### One character, one notebook, one sentence

Don Bradley traced exactly what happened.[^BradleyFAIR]

Joseph sent for his "Hebrew Bible & Lexicon" -- secular reference tools, not a seer stone.[^BradleyFAIR] He then compared characters on the Kinderhook plates with characters in the Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian Language (GAEL), a notebook compiled in Kirtland in 1835.

One character on the plates -- a boat-shaped symbol -- resembled a character on page 4 of the GAEL. The GAEL's assigned meaning for that character: "honor by birth, kingly power by the line of Pharaoh...possessor of heaven and earth."[^BradleyGAEL]

| What the GAEL said | What Clayton recorded |
| --- | --- |
| "honor by birth, kingly power by the line of Pharaoh...possessor of heaven and earth" | "a descendant of Ham, through the loins of Pharaoh, king of Egypt...received his kingdom from the Ruler of heaven and earth" |

The parallel is unmistakable. Joseph found one visual match between a plate character and a notebook character, read off the pre-existing definition, and that single sentence became the entire "translation."

Sylvester Emmons, a non-Mormon editor present in Nauvoo, confirmed the method in the *New York Herald*: "He compared them, in my presence, with his Egyptian Alphabet...and they are evidently the same characters."[^EmmonsHerald]

He *compared*. He didn't translate.

No second character match was found. Without additional correspondences between the plates and the GAEL, further work was impossible. Joseph quietly moved on.[^BradleyGAEL]

> **Bottom line:** The CES Letter's "translation" was a clerk's paraphrase of a single character comparison to a pre-existing notebook. Don Bradley proved the match. It was amateur linguistics -- not prophecy, not revelation, not a translation project.

---

### No manuscript, no scribe, no publication

The CES Letter treats this as a settled case: Joseph sat down, translated the plates, and got fooled. But where is the translation?

- No manuscript exists.
- No scribe was assigned.
- No dictation was witnessed.
- No text was published.
- Joseph never purchased the plates or made plans to work with them further.[^ScriptureCentralKnoWhy]

The *Times and Seasons*, the Church's own newspaper, published a notice about the plates and said their contents were "not yet ascertained."[^TimesSeasons] If Joseph had produced a translation, his own newspaper didn't know about it.

John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff announced in June 1843 that a translation would appear in the *Times and Seasons*.[^KimballEnsign] It never did. Because it never existed.

### The plates were fake -- the Church said so in 1981

The plates were a hoax. No dispute.

In April 1843, six bell-shaped brass plates with strange characters were dug from a burial mound near Kinderhook, Illinois. Three men -- Wilbur Fugate, Robert Wiley, and Bridge Whitton -- had fabricated them. Whitton cut the plates from brass; Fugate and Wiley etched characters using acid and beeswax and coated them with artificial rust.[^FugateConfession]

Fugate confessed in 1879: "Those plates are a HUMBUG, gotten up by Robert Wiley, Bridge Whitton and myself."[^FugateConfession]

In 1980, Professor D. Lynn Johnson of Northwestern University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering confirmed it metallurgically. Using a scanning electron microscope and scanning Auger microprobe, he found:[^KimballEnsign]

- Characters were **acid-etched**, not engraved -- consistent with nineteenth-century fabrication.
- **Nitric acid residues** remained in the grooves.
- The metal was a **nineteenth-century alloy**.

The Church published these findings in the August 1981 *Ensign*: "Kinderhook Plates Brought to Joseph Smith Appear to Be a Nineteenth-Century Hoax."[^KimballEnsign] The Church's [Gospel Topics page](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/kinderhook-plates?lang=eng) acknowledges the hoax openly.[^GospelTopics]

This is not a coverup. It's a forty-year-old public acknowledgment.

### Thirty-six years of silence from the forgers

If the Kinderhook plates were a trap designed to catch Joseph Smith producing a false translation -- and the trap worked -- why did the forgers wait thirty-six years to say so?

Fugate confessed in 1879. Joseph died in 1844. If Joseph had produced a public translation, the forgers had every reason to expose him immediately and humiliate him while he was alive. That was the entire point.

They didn't. The silence lasted decades.

The simplest explanation: the trap didn't spring. Joseph examined the plates briefly, made a casual comparison to his notebook, and moved on. There was nothing to expose.

---

### If Joseph were a fraud, why not translate them?

The CES Letter never asks this question -- and it matters more than anything else on this page.

If Joseph Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon and could invent scripture at will, the Kinderhook plates were a gift. Six metal plates covered in strange characters, brought to him by eager believers who desperately wanted another ancient record. The audience was primed. The setup was perfect.

A fraud would have produced a translation. He would have dictated something impressive, added it to the growing collection of restored scripture, and used it to reinforce his prophetic authority.

Joseph didn't. He compared one character to a notebook, said one sentence, and dropped the project entirely.

That behavior makes no sense for a con man. It makes perfect sense for a man who believed his translation ability came from God -- and who knew he hadn't received anything.

| Scenario | Expected behavior | What actually happened |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Joseph is a fraud** who invents translations | Produce a full translation to bolster his claims | No translation produced |
| **Joseph is a prophet** who translates by revelation | Attempt to engage, receive nothing, move on | One character comparison, then silence |

Don Bradley's conclusion: Joseph acted as "an enthusiastic, yet amateur, linguist" -- not as a fraudulent prophet and not as an inspired translator. His incorrect character match "was simply a mistake -- something he had never thought himself above."[^BradleyGAEL]

### How Joseph treated actual translations

The contrast between the Kinderhook plates and Joseph's real translation projects tells its own story.

| | Book of Mormon | Book of Abraham | Kinderhook Plates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Duration** | ~60 working days | Several years | ~5 days, then abandoned |
| **Method** | Seer stone / Urim and Thummim | Revelation + study | Hebrew lexicon and GAEL comparison |
| **Scribes** | Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, others | Multiple scribes | None |
| **Manuscript produced** | 270,000 words | Published text in *Times and Seasons* | Nothing |
| **Publication** | 1830 (full book) | 1842 (serialized) | Never |
| **Journal references** | Extensive | Extensive | One passing mention |
| **Purchased the source?** | N/A (plates held by angel) | Yes (Egyptian papyri) | No |

When Joseph undertook a genuine translation, there was a record. Scribes, manuscripts, dictation sessions, published installments. The Kinderhook plates produced none of this.

The CES Letter frames this as one of "three ancient records" Joseph claimed to translate, concluding: "The Book of Abraham: proven a fraud. The Kinderhook Plates: found to be a hoax. The Book of Mormon: the only one of the three for which we do not have the original."[^CLKinderhook3]

But Joseph never claimed to translate the Kinderhook plates. Placing a five-day character comparison alongside the Book of Mormon -- 270,000 words dictated from a seer stone in sixty working days with no substantive revisions -- is not a pattern. It's a false equivalence.

---

### What the Kinderhook plates actually reveal

The CES Letter asks what the Kinderhook incident "tells us about Joseph Smith's gift of translation." The answer isn't what the CES Letter expects.

It tells us Joseph distinguished between secular study and revelation -- even if he didn't always articulate the difference clearly in the moment. When he used scholarly tools (a Hebrew lexicon and the GAEL), he produced one speculative sentence and then nothing. When he used the means he claimed God provided, he produced the Book of Mormon.

The Kinderhook plates didn't expose a fraud. They exposed the limits of a man working without divine help -- which is exactly what you'd expect if the divine help was real.

> **Bottom line:** The Kinderhook plates were a hoax -- and the Church said so in 1981. But the CES Letter's case depends on Joseph Smith having produced a translation. He didn't. A clerk's third-person journal note about a single character comparison was later rewritten in first person for the *History of the Church*. No manuscript, no scribe, no dictation, no publication. If Joseph were a fraud who could fabricate scripture at will, he would have translated them. He didn't -- and that silence is the most telling evidence of all.
