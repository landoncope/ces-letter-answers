# Conclusion

The CES Letter raises real questions. Some of them are hard. This site has taken them seriously — section by section, source by source — because they deserve serious answers.

If you've read through the sections that matter most to you, you've seen what the evidence looks like when the missing context is supplied. The question now is what it all adds up to.

### The keystone held

The CES Letter opens its Book of Mormon section with "sudden death" framing — President Benson calling it "the keystone," Elder Holland calling it "a sudden death proposition."[^CLKeystone] The Conclusion doubles down: Joseph Smith was "either a Prophet of God...or one of the biggest frauds this world has ever seen. There is no middle ground."[^CLConclusion]

Accept the framing.

The Book of Mormon was dictated in roughly 60 working days. No notes. No outline. No manuscripts present. Joseph's face was in a hat looking at a seer stone while scribes wrote. Emma said he had "neither manuscript nor book to read from."[^EmmaSmith] Oliver Cowdery didn't purchase a Bible until months after the translation was finished.[^CowderyBible]

The text that came out of that process contains 337 proper names, three separate calendar systems, 550+ internally consistent geographic references — dictated orally, without maps. The original manuscript shows errors from *hearing*, not *reading*.[^SkousenManuscript]

And the evidence has only moved in one direction since 1830. Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts discovered in 1947 confirmed Book of Mormon Isaiah readings that diverge from the King James Bible.[^TvedtnesVariants] Three votive altars bearing the name NHM — dating to Lehi's lifetime — were found exactly where the Book of Mormon's travel narrative requires.[^NahomAston] LiDAR revealed 60,000 previously unknown structures in Guatemala's Mirador Basin in 2018. Stanford Carmack identified grammatical structures in the text that predate the KJV and were extinct by 1829 — patterns Joseph's own writing never uses.[^CarmackGrammar]

Of 226 anachronism claims tracked across 1,000+ critical publications since 1830, only 9.3% remain unconfirmed as of 2024. Cement, barley, steel swords, large-scale fortifications — all once called impossible, all now confirmed. The trend line runs one way across 190 years.[^RoperAnachronisms]

The CES Letter needs the Book of Mormon to fall. It didn't.

### No naturalistic theory works

No proposed explanation simultaneously accounts for the 60-day dictation with no notes, 550+ internally consistent geographic references, pre-KJV English grammar, Hebraisms invisible to English readers, Dead Sea Scroll confirmations, the Arabian trail, and a manuscript whose errors come from *hearing*, not reading.

The CES Letter gestures at *View of the Hebrews*, *The Late War*, and *The First Book of Napoleon* as potential sources. These are contradictory theories — Joseph couldn't have plagiarized all three simultaneously. The letter never commits to one because none work alone.

When you need three mutually exclusive explanations for the same book, you don't have an explanation. You have a problem.

### Eleven men who never recanted

Over 200 documented witness accounts exist for the Book of Mormon.[^WitnessRecord] Eleven named men put their names to a public declaration. Three of them were excommunicated, had personal grievances with Joseph Smith, and had every incentive to recant. None did — across 50 years.

The Eight Witnesses described a physical object handled in broad daylight. No vision language. No ambiguity. Even prominent critic Dan Vogel acknowledges the witnesses were sincere.

### The best-documented theophany in history

Nine accounts of the First Vision survive from Joseph Smith's lifetime — more than exist for Moses at the burning bush, Paul on the road to Damascus, or Isaiah's temple vision.[^HarperFirstVision]

The 1835 account *drops* angels from the 1832 account — the opposite of what fabrication produces. Cognitive memory research confirms the variation pattern matches genuine recollection, not embellishment.

Hostile newspapers reported angelic ordination claims in 1830 — 18 months before the CES Letter's alleged earliest date for priesthood restoration accounts. Oliver Cowdery maintained his priesthood restoration testimony through a decade of excommunication.

### What "dozens of serious issues" turned out to be

The [Introduction](/introduction) identified the CES Letter's core method: state something true-sounding, leave out the context that would reframe it, and let the reader's imagination close the gap.

That pattern ran through every section.

"100,000 changes" that turn out to be punctuation and spelling. A place-name map built on selective sound-alikes. A "smoking gun" papyrus that represents 2.5% of the original collection. A list of anachronisms where 90% have been confirmed over time. Expert quotes from 1912 presented as current scholarship. A Kinderhook "translation" that traces to a posthumous editorial conversion of someone else's journal entry.

The CES Letter's conclusion frames this as "dozens of serious issues."[^CLDozens] But section by section, what looked like dozens of independent problems turned out to be the same handful of patterns repeated: missing context, frozen scholarship, straw man premises, and volume masking thin evidence.

The accumulation strategy depends on speed. Stack enough concerns fast enough and even a sharp reader won't stop to check each one.

This site slowed down and checked. Thirteen sections. Every major claim. The pattern broke every time.

### A note from the author

My name is Landon, and I wrote in the [Introduction](/introduction) that I'm analytical by nature — I don't think questions are a failure of faith. I still believe that. More so now, having spent months in the primary sources.

I understand the pain the CES Letter describes. The feeling of "I was lied to" is real for people who grew up without hearing about seer stones, or plural marriage, or the different First Vision accounts.

Correlation-era materials did underemphasize difficult history. That was a mistake, and the Church has spent the last two decades correcting it — Joseph Smith Papers, Gospel Topics Essays, *Saints* volumes, the seer stone photo published in the *Ensign*. The trajectory is unmistakable.

But here's what I found when I went looking: the evidence doesn't say what the CES Letter needs it to say.

The Book of Mormon's existence is still unexplained by any naturalistic theory. The witnesses still held. The First Vision accounts still held. The system self-corrected where it needed to. Hard questions remain — some of them genuinely hard — but the foundation didn't crack.

The CES Letter's conclusion ends with a poem about lost faith. I don't mock that. The pain is real. But the path doesn't have to end where the CES Letter says it does — because the evidence doesn't end where the CES Letter stops quoting it.

If you're here because the CES Letter shook you, you're not alone. Keep studying. Follow the footnotes. Read the primary sources yourself. The truth isn't fragile — it holds up under scrutiny. That's the whole point.

> **Bottom line:** The CES Letter staked everything on the claim that the evidence, examined honestly, destroys faith. This site examined the evidence. It doesn't.
