# CES Letter Background

## Why Is It Called the "CES Letter"?

In 2013, the author says he addressed his compilation of criticisms to a Church Educational System (CES) director who had offered to help with his doubts.[^BHRobertsOriginStory] CES is the Church's educational arm — seminaries and institutes for youth and young adults.

The letter format makes the document feel like an honest seeker's questions. Whatever happened privately, it quickly took on a life of its own online. It has been revised multiple times, with public efforts to adjust its subtitle, framing, and tone.[^BHRobertsSubtitle][^BHRobertsTone]

## Who Wrote the CES Letter?

Jeremy Runnells authored the CES Letter, which he describes as "one Latter-day Saint's honest quest to get official answers from the LDS Church on its troubling origins, history, and practices."[^CLTagline]

I've never met Jeremy Runnells. I've watched interviews with him, and he comes across as a sincere person following his convictions. It's easy to forget people's humanity when all you see is text on a screen. I would genuinely like to see him return to the Church someday — he has the passion and ability to do a lot of good.

That said, the widely-accepted narrative — that the letter represents a troubled believer's sincere questions — doesn't hold up well under scrutiny. A 2024 investigation by researchers Michael W. Peterson and Jacob Z. Hess documents a different picture of the letter's origins.[^PublishPeace]

### The Origin Story

Peterson and Hess found that under an online persona he later acknowledged as his own, Runnells was actively criticizing the Church for months before writing the letter — suggesting his conclusions came before his "questions." There's no documented evidence of sustained attempts to get answers through Church leaders or official resources. And rather than treating the letter as a private inquiry, Runnells quickly shared it with a broad online audience, including some of the Church's most vocal critics. The earliest versions, before later revisions softened the language, were more overtly combative than one might expect from genuine questions.[^PublishPeace]

None of this makes the *questions themselves* invalid — many are worth taking seriously, which is what this site does. But it means the "just asking questions" framing should be taken with a grain of salt.

### How the CES Letter Has Evolved

The CES Letter is not a static document. Researchers have noted that portions of the original drew heavily from existing critical writings about the Church. The subtitle, title, and framing have been adjusted multiple times — sometimes with public input from online communities.[^BHRobertsSubtitle][^BHRobertsTone] What began as a letter has grown into a branded project with speaking engagements, merchandise, and continuous revisions.[^PublishPeace]

This matters because the CES Letter presents itself as a simple list of unanswered questions. It is not. It's an actively maintained and promoted work, and it reads differently once you know that.

## Why This Matters

This page isn't about dismissing someone's experience. It's about reading the CES Letter with open eyes. A document that presents itself as "just questions" but functions as a curated, evolving argument — refined and promoted over more than a decade — deserves to be read with that context in mind.

The claims still deserve answers. That's what the rest of this site provides.
