# 1769 KJV Errors

**The claim:**

> "What are 1769 King James Version edition errors doing in the Book of Mormon? A purported ancient text? Errors which are unique to the 1769 edition that Joseph Smith owned?"[^CLKJVErrors]

The CES Letter argues that the Book of Mormon contains translation errors specific to the 1769 King James Bible — the edition Joseph Smith owned — proving he copied from it rather than translating an ancient record.

**Which errors are actually unique to 1769?**

The CES Letter doesn't demonstrate which errors are unique to that edition versus earlier KJV printings. The claim is asserted but not shown.

When scholars have examined the specific translation choices the CES Letter highlights, they find the same readings in both the 1611 and 1769 editions.[^FAIRErrors] Take Isaiah 2:16 — one of the most commonly cited examples. The KJV renders the Hebrew *sekiyyot* as "pleasant pictures" when it actually means "ships" or "vessels":

| Edition | Isaiah 2:16 |
| --- | --- |
| **1611 KJV** | "And vpon all the ships of Tarshish, and vpon all **pleasant pictures**." |
| **1769 KJV** | "And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all **pleasant pictures**." |

Same mistranslation. The only differences are spelling and typesetting — *vpon* became *upon*. The "error" existed from the first KJV printing in 1611 and has nothing to do with the 1769 revision.[^KJVOnline1611]

What actually changed in 1769 was primarily *which words were marked as italicized* — a formatting convention, not a textual error. (For more on the italics question, see [KJV Italics](./kjv-italics).)

### What the "errors" actually are

FAIR cataloged 91 alleged translation errors in the Book of Mormon's biblical quotations and sorted them into categories.[^FAIRErrors] The results deflate the claim considerably:

- **Diachronic language shifts.** Words change meaning over centuries. At Isaiah 3:8 / 2 Nephi 13:8, the KJV renders the Hebrew *marah* as "provoke" — which modern translations render as "rebel against" or "defy." But "provoke" in 1611 English meant "to challenge" or "to defy" (from Latin *provoco*, "to call forth"). The word's semantic range narrowed over 400 years. That's not a translation error; it's older English.
- **Legitimate translation variants.** Where the Hebrew is ambiguous, multiple renderings are defensible. At Isaiah 2:6 / 2 Nephi 12:6, the KJV renders the Hebrew *sapaq* as "please themselves in the children of strangers." Modern translations prefer "strike hands with foreigners." Both readings are defensible — *sapaq* can mean clapping in delight or sealing a bargain.
- **Correct translations of older manuscripts.** Some Book of Mormon renderings align with the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament) or other ancient witnesses — sources Joseph Smith didn't have access to. At Isaiah 2:16 / 2 Nephi 12:16, the Book of Mormon adds "ships of the sea" — a phrase absent from the Hebrew Masoretic Text but present in the Septuagint.
- **Errors that don't change meaning.** A handful are genuine mistranslations. At Isaiah 3:2–3 / 2 Nephi 13:2–3, the KJV renders the Hebrew *qosem* as "prudent" (actually "diviner") and *nachash lachash* as "eloquent orator" (actually "skilled enchanter"). These are real errors — but Isaiah's point is that God will strip Jerusalem of *all* its leaders. Whether the list says "the prudent" or "the diviner," the meaning is unchanged.

### Over half the verses are modified

The most basic test for copying: does the text match?

| Metric | Data |
| --- | --- |
| Isaiah verses quoted in the Book of Mormon | 433 |
| Identical to the KJV | ~46% |
| Modified from the KJV | ~54% |

More than half the Isaiah verses diverge from the KJV in some way.[^GibsonIsaiah] That's the opposite of what plagiarism looks like. A person copying from a Bible reproduces the text. A person working from a different source overlaps where both sources agree and diverges where they don't.

### No Bible during translation

Multiple eyewitnesses who were present during the Book of Mormon translation stated Joseph used no notes, books, or reference materials during dictation.[^EmmaSmith] Emma Smith said he had neither "manuscript nor book to read from." David Whitmer described the stone-in-hat method — a process that makes consulting a Bible physically impractical.[^WhitmerAddress]

Oliver Cowdery purchased a Bible on October 8, 1829.[^CowderyBible] By then the Book of Mormon translation had been complete since late June, its copyright registered on June 11, and typesetting underway at Grandin's print shop since late August.

> **Bottom line:** The errors the CES Letter highlights exist across KJV editions back to 1611 — they aren't unique to 1769. And over half the Isaiah verses are modified, not copied.

## Readings Joseph Smith couldn't have produced

The KJV claims focus on what's *similar* between the Book of Mormon and the Bible. The differences tell a different story — some of them line up with ancient manuscripts Joseph Smith had no access to.

### Dead Sea Scroll alignments

The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 — more than a century after the Book of Mormon was published. Several Book of Mormon Isaiah readings that diverge from the KJV were confirmed by these ancient manuscripts:

| Passage | KJV | Book of Mormon | Ancient manuscript support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isaiah 48:11 / 1 Nephi 20:11 | "how should my name be polluted?" | "I will not suffer my name to be polluted" | 1QIsaᵃ, Vulgate, and Targum support the first-person form[^TvedtnesVariants] |
| Isaiah 48:13 / 1 Nephi 20:13 | (lacks conjunction) | adds "and" | 1QIsaᵃ, LXX, and Syriac all add "and"[^TvedtnesVariants] |
| Isaiah 2:16 / 2 Nephi 12:16 | "ships of Tarshish" | "ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish" | LXX reads "sea"; both lines likely original, one lost through scribal error[^TvedtnesVariants] |
| Isaiah 50:2 / 2 Nephi 7:2 | "their fish stinketh" | "their fish to stink because the waters are dried up" | 1QIsaᵃ and LXX preserve the "dried up" reading[^TvedtnesVariants] |

Joseph Smith published these readings in 1830. There is no evidence he had access to the Septuagint — a Greek translation that few Americans outside academia knew existed.[^LXXAccess] The Dead Sea Scrolls wouldn't be found for another 117 years.

### Archaic Hebrew forms

2 Nephi 20:29 reads "Ramath" where the KJV has "Ramah." The Book of Mormon preserves the older Hebrew feminine suffix (*-ath*) that fell out of use over centuries.[^TvedtnesVariants] The Dead Sea Scroll scribe actually added this same suffix as a superscript correction to his copy — suggesting even the ancient copyist's source manuscript had the older form the Book of Mormon preserves.

### Missing text restored

The Masoretic Text — the Hebrew text behind the KJV — appears to have lost words in several places through haplography. That's a scribal error where similar-looking words cause a copyist's eye to skip ahead, dropping a line. Tvedtnes identified multiple cases where the Book of Mormon preserves the fuller reading, with independent confirmation from the Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls, or other ancient witnesses.[^TvedtnesVariants]

At 1 Nephi 21:1, the Book of Mormon adds an entire poetic preface to Isaiah 49:1 that doesn't appear in the KJV. The addition has chiastic structure (ABCDC'B'A') — a sophisticated ancient Hebrew literary form that wasn't recognized by Western scholars until the twentieth century.[^TvedtnesVariants]

### The variant scorecard

Tvedtnes analyzed 234 Isaiah variants between the Book of Mormon and the KJV, rating each based on ancient manuscript evidence:[^TvedtnesVariants]

| Rating | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Favor the Book of Mormon | 59 |
| Neutral | 126 |
| Favor the KJV | 49 |

More variants are confirmed by ancient evidence favoring the Book of Mormon than favoring the KJV. A 19th-century plagiarist working from a KJV Bible cannot produce readings that align with manuscripts he didn't know existed.

> **Bottom line:** Multiple Book of Mormon readings were confirmed by ancient manuscripts discovered a century after Joseph Smith's death. A plagiarist copying from a KJV Bible cannot produce readings that align with the Dead Sea Scrolls.

## Isaiah isn't pasted in — it's woven in

The "copying" charge assumes Isaiah was dumped into the Book of Mormon without thought. The text tells a different story.

### Nephi selects, he doesn't transcribe

Nephi had access to the entire brass plates. He chose specific Isaiah chapters — and the choices aren't random:

| Isaiah chapters | Book of Mormon | Narrative context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 48–49 | 1 Nephi 20–21 | Family's exile from Jerusalem — language mirrors their displacement |
| 2–14 | 2 Nephi 12–24 | Four-stage prophetic framework (Christ, scattering, Gentiles, restoration) |
| 29 | 2 Nephi 27 | Adapted into Nephi's own prophecy via *pesher* method |

Isaiah 48–49 mirror the family's situation directly: exile from Jerusalem, broken off and scattered, promises of a new covenant land. S. Kent Brown showed that Isaiah's language tracks their lived experience — water from rocks in the desert (Isaiah 48:21), peace "as a river" (48:18) echoing Lehi naming the river Laman.[^BrownIsaiah]

Isaiah 2–14 in 2 Nephi follows a four-stage prophetic framework that John Welch identified: Christ's coming, Israel's scattering, the Gentile era, and Israel's restoration.[^WelchPropheticView] That framework isn't laid out in Isaiah's own writings. Someone had to construct it and then map Isaiah onto it.

### A formula, not a patchwork

Book of Mormon prophets don't just drop Isaiah quotations into the text. They follow a consistent pattern: introduce a theme, quote Isaiah, then interpret the passage and apply it to their people.[^BensonHopkin] Nephi provides five interpretive keys immediately after quoting Isaiah 2–14, combining intellectual tools (understand Jewish prophetic conventions, know the geography) with spiritual ones (cultivate the spirit of prophecy).[^ParryKeys]

The entire Isaiah block in 2 Nephi is bracketed by an *inclusio* — a literary framing device. The opening (2 Nephi 5:30–31): "thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are *good*." The closing (2 Nephi 25:7–8): "for *their good* have I written them." The Egyptian name Nephi itself means "good" — a wordplay that echoes through the framing.[^BowenInclusio]

### Nephi rewrites Isaiah, not just quotes it

At 2 Nephi 12:12 and 12:14, Nephi added clauses absent from the Hebrew Masoretic Text, universalizing Isaiah's judgment imagery to apply to "all nations." This matches his stated purpose in 2 Nephi 25:3: "that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon *all* nations."[^BowenGoyim]

When Nephi reaches Isaiah 29, he doesn't just quote — he adapts the language using a *pesher* method (ancient Jewish interpretive commentary), claiming the adapted words as his own prophecy rather than attributing them to Isaiah.[^ClowardIsaiah29] He's not copying. He's doing what ancient prophets did with earlier prophetic texts.

Nephi wrote 1 Nephi decades after the events it describes — giving him time to shape the record deliberately around Isaiah as its organizing spine, not as an afterthought.[^SpencerVision]

> **Bottom line:** A plagiarist copies text. Nephi *selects* specific chapters that mirror his family's exile, frames them with interpretive commentary, modifies them to match his theological purpose, and brackets the entire block with literary devices. That's not copying from a Bible on the nightstand.

## The book still exists

Every KJV-related criticism, even if granted in full, concerns roughly 6–7% of the Book of Mormon's text.[^BarlowMormonsBible] The rest — the narrative, the theology, the proper names, the internal geography, the Hebraisms, the chiastic structures — remains. The CES Letter's approach to the Book of Mormon is to identify individual weak points and hope the accumulation will lead the reader to dismiss the whole.

But weak points in the armor don't explain how the armor was forged. A 270,000-word book dictated in [around 60 working days](/introduction) with no outline, no notes, and [no substantive revisions](https://scripturecentral.org/evidence/book-of-mormon-evidence-no-substantive-revisions) is not explained by pointing out that some of its biblical quotations resemble the KJV.

If a fraudster assembled the Book of Mormon from whole cloth and was clever enough to produce its complexity, why would he have been careless enough to copy Bible verses?

> **Bottom line:** The KJV-related claims address 6–7% of the Book of Mormon's text. The other 93% — the narrative, the theology, the names, the structure — still needs an explanation.

[^BarlowMormonsBible]: Philip Barlow, *Mormons and the Bible* (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991). Barlow documented that 27 of the Book of Mormon's 239 chapters consist primarily of biblical quotation — roughly one in nine.

[^LXXAccess]: The first English translation of the Septuagint was Charles Thomson's, published in Philadelphia in 1808 in a print run of just 1,000 sets — most of which went unsold and were destroyed. Fewer than twenty complete sets survive. The widely available Brenton translation did not appear until 1844. Greek editions (Grabe, Holmes and Parsons) were expensive multi-volume scholarly works published at Oxford, accessible only in university libraries. Joseph Smith could not read Greek; his earliest documented contact with the language was in late 1835. See John W.
