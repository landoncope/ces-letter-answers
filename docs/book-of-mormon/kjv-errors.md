# KJV Errors

**The claim:**

> "What are 1769 King James Version edition errors doing in the Book of Mormon? A purported ancient text? Errors which are unique to the 1769 edition that Joseph Smith owned?"[^CLKJVErrors]

The CES Letter also argues that KJV italicized words and KJV mistranslations appear unchanged in the Book of Mormon — claims covered in dedicated sister articles on [KJV Italics](/book-of-mormon/kjv-italics) and [KJV Mistranslations](/book-of-mormon/kjv-mistranslations).[^CLKJVItalics][^CLMistranslations]

**Which errors are actually "unique to 1769"?**

---

## The "1769 edition" claim

### The claim falls apart on inspection

The CES Letter asserts these errors are "unique to the 1769 edition that Joseph Smith owned." It never demonstrates this. Not once. No specific error is shown to exist in the 1769 edition but not in earlier printings.

Take Isaiah 2:16 — the most commonly cited example. The KJV renders the Hebrew *sekiyyot* as "pleasant pictures" when it actually refers to ships or vessels.[^PikeSeely]

| Edition | Isaiah 2:16 |
| --- | --- |
| **1611 KJV** | "And vpon all the ships of Tarshish, and vpon all **pleasant pictures**." |
| **1769 KJV** | "And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all **pleasant pictures**." |

Same mistranslation. The only differences are spelling and typesetting — *vpon* became *upon*. The "error" has been there since 1611.[^1611Facsimile]

FAIR examined the CES Letter's full list and concluded: "There are no errors that are unique to the 1769 edition."[^FAIRDetailed] What the 1769 Blayney revision actually changed was spelling, typesetting, and *which words were italicized* — not the underlying translation.[^Scrivener]

Royal Skousen's definitive analysis found the KJV text used in the Book of Mormon matches editions from the 1670s or later based on substantive differences, and from the 1770s when italics changes are included — he identified the 1775 edition as the likely source.[^SkousenKJVQuotations] That means the Book of Mormon tracks a specific post-1770 KJV edition. It doesn't mean the CES Letter's claim about "1769 errors" is right — the errors themselves are centuries older.

> **Bottom line:** The CES Letter's headline claim — "errors unique to the 1769 edition" — is factually wrong. The same translation choices appear in the 1611 KJV and every edition after it.

## What copying can't explain

The KJV claims focus on what's *similar* between the Book of Mormon and the Bible. The differences tell a different story.

### Dead Sea Scroll alignments

The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 — more than a century after the Book of Mormon was published. Several Book of Mormon Isaiah readings that diverge from the KJV were confirmed by these ancient manuscripts:

| Passage | KJV | Book of Mormon | Ancient manuscript support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isaiah 48:11 / 1 Nephi 20:11 | "how should my name be polluted?" | "I will not suffer my name to be polluted" | 1QIsa-a, Vulgate, and Targum support the first-person form |
| Isaiah 48:13 / 1 Nephi 20:13 | (lacks conjunction) | adds "and" | 1QIsa-a, LXX, and Syriac all add "and" |
| Isaiah 2:16 / 2 Nephi 12:16 | "ships of Tarshish" | "ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish" | LXX reads "sea"; both lines likely original, one lost through scribal error |
| Isaiah 50:2 / 2 Nephi 7:2 | "their fish stinketh" | "their fish to stink because the waters are dried up" | 1QIsa-a reads "dry up"; the BOM combines KJV "stink" with the DSS "dried up" element — a hybrid reading drawing on both traditions[^TvedtnesVariants] |

Joseph Smith published these readings in 1830. He couldn't read Greek. The first English translation of the Septuagint (Thomson, 1808) had a print run of just 1,000 sets — most went unsold and very few complete sets survive today.[^LXXAccess] The widely available Brenton translation didn't appear until 1844. The Dead Sea Scrolls wouldn't be found for another 117 years.

A skeptic can note that the Thomson Septuagint *existed* and was in English. That's fair. But the question isn't whether a single copy might have been physically locatable somewhere in America. It's whether a young man in Palmyra, New York — who didn't know Jerusalem had walls — obtained a rare four-volume scholarly set, identified the specific verses where it diverged from his KJV, and wove those readings into a dictated text with no notes and no revision. The Dead Sea Scroll alignments are even harder to explain this way, since those manuscripts were buried in caves until 1947.

### The variant scorecard

Tvedtnes analyzed 234 Isaiah variants between the Book of Mormon and the KJV, rating each based on ancient manuscript evidence:[^TvedtnesVariants]

| Rating | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Favor the Book of Mormon | 59 |
| Neutral | 126 |
| Favor the KJV | 49 |

A 19th-century plagiarist working from a KJV Bible should produce the opposite pattern — zero readings that align with manuscripts he didn't know existed, and all variants trending away from ancient witnesses. The margin — 59 to 49 — is modest. But the *direction* is impossible under a plagiarism model.

### Archaic Hebrew forms

2 Nephi 20:29 reads "Ramath" where the KJV has "Ramah." John Tvedtnes interpreted this as the older Hebrew feminine suffix (*-ath*) that fell out of use over centuries. The Dead Sea Scroll scribe actually added this same suffix as a superscript correction to his copy — suggesting even the ancient copyist's source had the older form.[^TvedtnesVariants]

Royal Skousen offers a different explanation: "Ramath" may be a scribal error by Oliver Cowdery, influenced by the proximity of "Aiath" (v. 28) and "Hamath" (v. 9).[^SkousenKJVQuotations] The evidence is contested. But scribal errors don't typically *restore* archaic Hebrew morphology confirmed by ancient manuscripts — especially a suffix that a Dead Sea Scroll copyist independently corrected his own text to include.

### A hidden Hebraism

At 2 Nephi 12:2 (Isaiah 2:2), the Book of Mormon uniquely reads "when" instead of "that." Paul Hoskisson demonstrated this creates a Hebrew *waw* functioning as "then" — a protasis-apodosis construction found in Gesenius's Hebrew grammar.[^HoskissonHebraism] The simplest English explanation is a trivial word substitution. But the substitution happens to produce a construction that works in Hebrew in ways the KJV reading doesn't. Joseph Smith had no Hebrew training until years later.

### Missing text restored

At 1 Nephi 21:1, the Book of Mormon adds an entire poetic preface to Isaiah 49:1 that doesn't appear in the KJV. The addition has chiastic structure — a Hebrew literary form whose systematic study began with Nils Lund in 1930.[^TvedtnesVariants][^LundChiasmus] Joseph Smith published this in 1830. Lund wouldn't describe the pattern for another century.

The Masoretic Text appears to have lost words in several places through haplography — a scribal error where similar-looking words cause a copyist's eye to skip ahead, dropping a line. Tvedtnes identified multiple cases where the Book of Mormon preserves the fuller reading, confirmed by the Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls, or other ancient witnesses.[^TvedtnesVariants]

### Early Modern English that predates the KJV

Stanford Carmack's research identifies grammatical structures in the Book of Mormon that predate the King James Bible and were extinct by 1829. These aren't KJV borrowings — they're *older* than the KJV.[^CarmackPseudoArchaic]

| Feature | Book of Mormon | KJV | Pseudo-biblical texts (1774-1816) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Periphrastic *did* (past tense) | 24% | 1.2% | Never matching BOM |
| Personal *which* | 52% | 12.6% | Low |
| Finite complement after *command* | 77.2% | 25.5% | 25.7% |
| *Lest*-*shall* construction | 14 instances (17x Bible rate) | Rare | 0 instances |

Joseph Smith's own 1832 manuscript shows modern English grammar — not the archaic patterns found throughout the Book of Mormon.[^CarmackGrammar] Pseudo-biblical authors of his era produced measurably less archaic syntax. Over 90 archaic lexical items in the Book of Mormon had meanings dating from the 1530s-1730s, and these usages do *not* appear in the KJV — ruling out the King James Bible as their source.[^ArchaicVocab]

If Joseph copied the KJV, where did the pre-KJV English come from?

<YouTubeEmbed video-id="o2dI02Wn5KE" title="Does the Book of Mormon Really Have 'Bad' Grammar?" />

### Hebraisms not derivable from the KJV

The **if-and conditional** is the clearest example. Mosiah 2:21's original manuscript reads: "if ye should serve him with your whole soul — *and* yet ye would be unprofitable servants." This construction appears nowhere in the KJV. Donald Parry: "The Book of Mormon's use of Hebraistic literary forms cannot simply be attributed to Joseph Smith's familiarity with the English Bible."[^ParryHebraisms]

The if-and conditional appears 7 times in Helaman 12:13-21 alone. Later editors removed it — they didn't recognize it. If Joseph invented the text, why would he insert a grammatical construction invisible to English readers, one his own editors deleted?

Other Hebraisms include cognate accusatives ("dreamed a dream," "cursed with a sore cursing") and construct-state word order ("works of righteousness" rather than "righteous works").[^ParryHebraisms]

### The original manuscript shows dictation, not copying

Royal Skousen's analysis of the original manuscript reveals errors characteristic of *hearing*, not *reading*:[^SkousenManuscript]

- "Coriantumr" was initially written "Coriantummer" — a phonetic mishearing. No English word ends in "mr." Joseph was spelling out letters from a visionary text, not reading from a page.
- Fourteen Hebrew-like conditional clauses use "and" instead of "then" — a non-English pattern that survived in the original manuscript before later editors removed it.

No Bible was present during translation. Emma Smith: "He had neither manuscript nor book to read from."[^EmmaSmith] Oliver Cowdery purchased a Bible on October 8, 1829 — months after the translation was completed in late June.[^CowderyBible]

The relevant objection: perhaps Joseph didn't need a Bible *open during dictation*. Perhaps he'd studied and memorized significant portions of Isaiah beforehand. But the eyewitness evidence and his demonstrated ignorance of basic biblical geography (he didn't know Jerusalem had walls) make extensive prior memorization of 21 Isaiah chapters — with systematic modifications — difficult to sustain.

### Nephi's Isaiah is woven, not pasted

A person plagiarizing copies text. Nephi *selects* specific Isaiah chapters, frames them with commentary, modifies them for his theological purpose, and brackets the entire block with literary devices.

Isaiah 48-49 mirror the family's displacement from Jerusalem — water from rocks in the desert (48:21), peace "as a river" (48:18) echoing Lehi naming the river Laman.[^BrownIsaiah] Isaiah 2-14 follows a four-stage prophetic framework (Christ's coming, Israel's scattering, the Gentile era, restoration) that isn't laid out in Isaiah itself — someone had to construct it.[^WelchPropheticView]

When Nephi reaches Isaiah 29, he doesn't just quote. He adapts the language using a *pesher* method — ancient Jewish interpretive commentary found in the Dead Sea Scrolls — transforming Isaiah's symbolic "sealed book" into a specific prophecy about the Book of Mormon's own coming forth.[^ClowardIsaiah29] The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947. Pesher interpretation was only identified *after* those scrolls were studied. Joseph Smith in 1829 had no access to the Dead Sea Scrolls and no knowledge of pesher methodology.

The entire Isaiah block in 2 Nephi is bracketed by an *inclusio*: 2 Nephi 5:30-31 ("which are good in my sight") and 2 Nephi 25:7-8 ("for *their good* have I written them"). The Egyptian name Nephi itself means "good" — a wordplay echoing through the framing.[^BowenInclusio] At 2 Nephi 12:12 and 12:14, Nephi added clauses absent from the Hebrew Masoretic Text, universalizing Isaiah's judgment imagery to apply to "all nations" — matching his stated purpose in 2 Nephi 25:3.[^BowenGoyim]

## The real question: why KJV language at all?

Strip away the "1769" framing and a legitimate question remains. The Book of Mormon's Isaiah chapters follow the KJV closely. Some KJV translation choices are wrong. Why would an ancient text, independently translated, reproduce those choices?

### What the "errors" actually are

FAIR cataloged 91 alleged translation errors in the Book of Mormon's biblical quotations and sorted them.[^FAIRErrors]

| Category | Example | What's actually happening |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Diachronic language shifts** | Isaiah 3:8 / 2 Nephi 13:8: "provoke" vs. modern "rebel against" | "Provoke" meant "to challenge" in 1611 English. The word narrowed over 400 years. Not a mistranslation — older English. |
| **Genuine errors that don't change meaning** | Isaiah 3:2-3 / 2 Nephi 13:2-3: "prudent" (actually "diviner"), "eloquent orator" (actually "skilled enchanter") | Real errors. Isaiah's point — God stripping Jerusalem of all its leaders — is unchanged. But the errors are still there. |

Some of these are legitimate translation variants where the Hebrew is ambiguous. Others are correct translations of older manuscripts — the Book of Mormon's "ships of the sea" at 2 Nephi 12:16 is absent from the Hebrew Masoretic Text but present in the Septuagint.[^LXXAccess]

And some are genuine mistranslations. "Pleasant pictures" for Hebrew *sekiyyot* (ships) and "eloquent orator" for *nachash lachash* (skilled enchanter) are simply wrong. If the Book of Mormon were a fully independent translation, these specific English errors shouldn't appear.

### The 46% overlap and the 54% that diverges

The most basic test for copying: does the text match?

| Study | Isaiah verses examined | Identical to KJV | Modified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gibson (1995) | 433 | ~46% | ~54% |
| Tvedtnes (1981) | 478 | 201 (42%) | 207 (43%), plus ~70 paraphrased or mixed |
| Ellertson (2001) | 433 | 217 (50%) | 216 (50%), containing 370 total variants |

Three studies, same pattern: roughly half the Isaiah verses diverge from the KJV in some way.[^GibsonIsaiah][^TvedtnesVariants][^EllertsonThesis]

The 46% verbatim overlap demands explanation. No two independent translations of the same Hebrew source would produce that much word-for-word agreement — the overlap comes from the KJV itself. The faithful explanation isn't "the texts are unrelated." It's that the translation used KJV language as its English vehicle where the underlying texts aligned. Blake Ostler's expansion theory — the earliest formal articulation of this model — proposed exactly this: the Book of Mormon's English is a modern expansion of an ancient source, with KJV phrasing serving as the medium for passages the texts shared.[^OstlerExpansion]

The 54% that diverges matters too. Many modifications are small — a word changed, a phrase added — but the *pattern* of those changes is significant. They cluster around italicized words (see [KJV Italics](/book-of-mormon/kjv-italics)) and around passages where ancient manuscripts preserve different readings. That distribution isn't what you'd expect from a copyist making random alterations to disguise plagiarism. It's what you'd expect from a text that shares a common ancestor with the KJV but comes through a different transmission path.

## Hard questions

The CES Letter's version of this criticism is easy to answer. The scholarly version is harder. Intellectual honesty requires engaging it.

### Wright and the italics pattern

David P. Wright's argument is the most rigorous textual case for KJV dependence.[^Wright] His key evidence: italicized words account for only 3.6% of the KJV Isaiah text but generate 22-38% of the Book of Mormon's variants. Stan Spencer refined this to a 40:1 omission ratio.[^SpencerMissingWords] Wright argues this statistical signature proves someone was working directly from a printed KJV.

Spencer's "Missing Words" hypothesis offers a response. If the text Joseph received had already been through a translation layer that stripped italicized words — because they weren't in the source language — Joseph's attempts to fill the gaps would produce exactly this pattern: high omission rates, broken grammar, inconsistent treatment, and later corrections.

The 1831 *Sun* newspaper independently records Martin Harris saying Joseph "should omit all the words in the Bible that were printed in Italic."[^TheSun1831] Under the Missing Words hypothesis, this corroborates a translation mechanism that stripped italic words. Under the copying model, it describes someone reading from a physical KJV and skipping italicized words. The evidence is genuinely ambiguous.

Wright's critique doesn't account for Book of Mormon readings confirmed by the Dead Sea Scrolls. But his italics evidence is real. The full statistical analysis is at [KJV Italics](/book-of-mormon/kjv-italics).

### English polysemy variants

Wright identifies cases where Book of Mormon variants seem to arise from the multiple meanings of English words rather than from Hebrew. At Isaiah 2:10, the KJV reads "for fear of the Lord" where "for" is a causal preposition (meaning "because of"). The Book of Mormon shifts it into a subject phrase — a variant that exploits the ambiguity of the *English* word "for" but not the Hebrew *mippenei*, which is unambiguous.

The expansion theory could account for this if the translation operated through English. But the variant exploits English ambiguity, not Hebrew, and that's hard to dismiss.

### Genuine KJV translation errors

A handful of KJV translation choices in the Book of Mormon are not defensible as "legitimate variants" or "diachronic shifts." The expansion theory offers a framework: God used familiar KJV phrasing where the texts aligned, and the translation carried some KJV-specific choices along with it. But that also means the English text is not a word-for-word rendering of the plates — it's mediated through a translation process that drew on existing English scripture.

### The Deutero-Isaiah question

The CES Letter doesn't explicitly raise this. The strongest form of the KJV criticism does.

Mainstream biblical scholarship holds that Isaiah 40-55 was written during the Babylonian exile (c. 550-539 BCE) — roughly 50-60 years *after* Lehi left Jerusalem (c. 600 BCE). The evidence includes a complete thematic shift at chapter 40, a new audience, distinctive vocabulary and theology, and Cyrus named by name (Isaiah 44:28, 45:1).[^Hardy]

The Book of Mormon quotes from Isaiah 48-54 (1 Nephi 20-21, 2 Nephi 7-8). If those chapters didn't exist before the exile, Nephi couldn't have had them on the brass plates. Colby Townsend extends the problem: even Isaiah 2-14 underwent post-exilic editorial layering. Grant Hardy, a faithful Latter-day Saint scholar, concedes that "even chapters 1-39 underwent considerable revision and augmentation after 600 BCE."[^Hardy][^Townsend]

The common apologetic response — "scholars who divide Isaiah don't believe in prophecy" — is, in Hardy's words, "an inadequate (and inaccurate) response to a significant body of detailed historical and literary analysis."[^Hardy] Many scholars who accept multiple authorship are believing Christians.

The harder edge: Deutero-Isaiah phrases appear not just in quoted chapters but in the Book of Mormon's own original compositions — Lehi's sermon adapts Isaiah 52:1-2, Abinadi quotes Isaiah 53 in full, Jesus quotes Isaiah 52 in 3 Nephi 20, and Moroni adapts Isaiah 52 language at the book's close.

Several responses have weight. **The brass plates aren't the Masoretic Text** — different manuscript traditions preserve different material, and the Dead Sea Scrolls proved that pre-Masoretic Isaiah texts existed with readings the Masoretic tradition lost.[^TvedtnesVariants] **The expansion theory** addresses why KJV phrasing appears: D&C 1:24 describes God speaking "after the manner of their language," which already implies the English text is adapted to its audience. If the translation was expansive enough to use familiar scriptural language, it could render what ancient authors said using post-exilic phrases the modern audience would recognize. **The Isaian school model** — Daniel Ellsworth argues for "a core set of Isaianic writings that were sealed up by Isaiah's disciples (Isaiah 8:16) and then opened, assembled, expanded, and redacted over centuries."[^EllsworthIsaiah] This can't fully account for Cyrus named by name in Isaiah 45, but it reframes the question from "was all of Isaiah written by one person?" to "what did the brass plates actually contain?"

::: info The Deutero-Isaiah Difficulty
The evidence for composite authorship is substantial. The best faithful responses reframe the problem rather than eliminate it. These are real questions that deserve more scholarly attention from believing scholars — and they arise from taking the evidence seriously, not from ignoring it.
:::

### The tight/loose translation dilemma

Eyewitness accounts describe tight control — Joseph reading specific words that appeared on the seer stone, the stone not advancing until the scribe had it right. But tight divine control should produce better readings than the KJV, not identical errors. If the translation was loose enough for KJV phrasing to serve as a vehicle, the tight-control accounts need reinterpreting.

No current translation theory resolves every piece of evidence simultaneously. The expansion theory comes closest — accommodating KJV language, meaningful departures, archaic English, and ancient manuscript alignments. It requires accepting that the Book of Mormon's English text is a divinely mediated rendering, not a mechanical transcript of plate language. Brant Gardner developed this into a comprehensive translation theory.[^GardnerGift]

---

## The italics pattern and the JST question

The CES Letter raises two additional claims that deserve direct engagement. Both are covered in depth in dedicated sister articles.

### KJV italicized words

Italicized KJV words — translator-supplied words not in the original Hebrew — are *omitted* from the Book of Mormon at 40 times the rate of non-italicized words. The result is broken English like "Wo me! for I undone" that no copyist would write. The CES Letter presents two examples where italicized words appear and treats them as proof of copying. The full statistical picture tells the opposite story.[^SpencerMissingWords]

The pattern, the broken grammar, the 1837 corrections, and the 1831 eyewitness account are analyzed in full at [KJV Italics](/book-of-mormon/kjv-italics).

### Book of Mormon vs. JST

The claim that the Book of Mormon "should match" the JST assumes the JST is a word-for-word restoration of original biblical text. Leading JST scholars reject that premise — Kent Jackson describes it as "recasting the text into a new form by means of inspiration."[^JacksonJST] The 3 Nephi Sermon on the Mount has dozens of deliberate theological changes from Matthew, and at least one — omitting "without a cause" in 3 Nephi 12:22 — aligns with the earliest Greek manuscripts against the KJV. The full analysis is at [KJV Mistranslations](/book-of-mormon/kjv-mistranslations).

---

## The book still exists

Every KJV-related criticism, even if granted in full, concerns roughly 6-7% of the Book of Mormon's text — the biblical quotations.[^BarlowMormonsBible] The rest — roughly 270,000 words of narrative, theology, proper names, internal geography, Hebraisms, chiastic structures — remains.

The CES Letter's implicit argument is that KJV dependence in the Isaiah chapters undermines the entire book's translation claims. That's a logical leap.

A book dictated in [around 60 working days](/introduction) with no outline, no notes, and [no substantive revisions](https://scripturecentral.org/evidence/book-of-mormon-evidence-no-substantive-revisions) still needs its own explanation.[^SkousenManuscript] Pre-KJV English grammar that neither Joseph Smith nor any pseudo-biblical author of his era could produce. Hebraisms invisible to English readers, removed by later editors who didn't recognize them. Readings confirmed by ancient manuscripts buried in caves until 1947.

The KJV overlap is a real feature of the text. So is everything pointing the other direction.

<YouTubeEmbed video-id="ppB8DUsCUyo" title="Why Do Bible Passages Show Up in the Book of Mormon?" />

> **Bottom line:** The "1769 edition errors" claim is factually wrong — the errors exist in every KJV edition back to 1611. Over half the Isaiah verses are modified, not copied. Several readings match ancient manuscripts discovered a century later. The KJV overlap raises legitimate questions about translation — but so does every piece of evidence the copying theory can't explain.
