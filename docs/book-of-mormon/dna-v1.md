# DNA

**The claim:**

> "DNA analysis has concluded that Native American Indians do not originate from the Middle East or from Israelites but rather from Asia. Why did the Church change the following section of the introduction page in the 2006 edition Book of Mormon, shortly after the DNA results were released?"[^CLDNA]

The CES Letter then highlights the 2006 change from "the Lamanites, and they are *the principal* ancestors of the American Indians" to "the Lamanites, and they are *among the* ancestors of the American Indians."

It adds: "The Church conceded in its January 2014 *Book of Mormon and DNA Studies* essay that the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA."[^CLDNA]

The implication is clear: DNA proved the Book of Mormon wrong, so the Church quietly moved the goalposts.

**But here's the question the CES Letter never asks: Was the DNA argument ever scientifically valid in the first place?**

---

### What the DNA argument requires

For DNA to "disprove" the Book of Mormon, you need a chain of assumptions. Every link must hold:

1. We know what Lehi's family's DNA looked like.
2. Their genetic signature would survive 2,600 years of mixing, drift, and bottleneck events.
3. It would be detectable in modern Native American populations.
4. Its absence means the people never existed.

Not one of these assumptions holds up.

---

### We don't know what Lehi's DNA looked like

This is the most basic problem, and critics almost never address it.

Jerusalem in 600 BC was a crossroads city. Its population had been mixing with Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and other Near Eastern groups for centuries.[^GospelTopicsEssay] The DNA of a single family leaving Jerusalem would not necessarily carry markers that modern geneticists would classify as "distinctly Israelite."

Even today, Jewish populations worldwide carry widely varying genetic signatures depending on their geographic history.[^PeregoStandpoint] Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jews have distinct genetic profiles. There is no single "Jewish DNA" marker that would identify a sixth-century BC Israelite family.

Without knowing the starting point, the test is meaningless. You cannot search for something when you don't know what it looks like.[^WhitingPhylogenetic]

---

### A small family absorbed into millions

The Book of Mormon describes a few dozen migrants entering a hemisphere already populated by millions.

This isn't speculation. The scientific consensus places human habitation of the Americas at least 15,000 years before Lehi's departure from Jerusalem.[^Raghavan2015] By 600 BC, population estimates for the Americas range from 10 million to over 50 million people.[^GospelTopicsEssay]

| Group | Approximate size |
| --- | --- |
| Lehi's party (c. 600 BC) | ~20–30 people |
| Mulek's party (c. 587 BC) | Unknown, likely small |
| Existing American population (600 BC) | 10–50+ million |

When a small group merges into a vastly larger population, the small group's genetic markers are swamped within a few generations. This isn't a defense invented by apologists. It's a basic principle of population genetics called the **founder effect**.[^GospelTopicsEssay]

Ugo Perego, a population geneticist who earned his PhD from the University of Pavia studying Native American mitochondrial DNA, puts it plainly: the situation is like searching a database for a suspect whose DNA profile you don't have. The methodology itself cannot succeed.[^PeregoStandpoint]

---

### Genetic drift: DNA vanishes on its own

Even without being swamped by a larger population, genetic markers disappear over time through **genetic drift** — the random loss of DNA lineages across generations.

The Iceland study makes this concrete. Researchers compared mitochondrial DNA from early Icelandic settlers (recovered from ancient bones) with their modern descendants. The result: the majority of founding lineages had simply vanished in roughly 1,000 years. The genetic profile of modern Icelanders bears little resemblance to the actual founders.[^HelgasonIceland]

Iceland is a small, isolated island with meticulous genealogical records. If genetic drift can erase founding lineages there in 1,000 years, it can do far more damage over 2,600 years in the Americas — where populations were larger, more mobile, and subjected to catastrophic bottleneck events.[^GospelTopicsEssay]

---

### The European conquest destroyed the evidence

Between 1492 and 1900, the Indigenous population of the Americas collapsed by an estimated 90–95%.[^GospelTopicsEssay] Entire civilizations, language families, and genetic lineages were wiped out.

Molecular anthropologist Michael Crawford described the result: the European conquest "squeezed the entire Amerindian population through a genetic bottleneck," reducing gene pools "from 1/3 to 1/25 of their previous size."[^CrawfordBottleneck]

A 2016 study of pre-Columbian South American remains published in *Science Advances* found that **all 92 ancient mitochondrial lineages they sequenced were absent from modern populations**.[^FehrenSchmitz] Every one. Not most. All.

| Study | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| Llamas, Fehren-Schmitz, et al. (2016) | 92 ancient South American mtDNA lineages — all absent from modern populations |
| Helgason et al. (2009) | Majority of founding Icelandic mtDNA lineages lost in ~1,000 years |
| Crawford (1998) | Post-contact bottleneck reduced Native American gene pools by 67–96% |

Ancient lineages vanish routinely. The absence of a specific genetic signature in modern populations tells you nothing about whether that group existed 2,600 years ago.

### The Book of Mormon never claimed an empty continent

The CES Letter treats the DNA argument as if the Book of Mormon describes Lehi's family arriving on a deserted landmass and populating the entire hemisphere. It doesn't.

The text itself contains multiple indicators of pre-existing populations:

- **Sherem** appears in Jacob 7 as a stranger who "came among the people of Nephi" and "had a perfect knowledge of the language" — suggesting someone from outside the original colony.[^Sherem]
- **Rapid population growth.** Within just a few decades, the Nephites are fighting wars. The numbers don't work unless outsiders are being absorbed into both groups.[^SorensonOthers]
- **The Mulekites** had already mixed so thoroughly with local populations that their language was unrecognizable to the Nephites when the two groups met (Omni 1:17) — far more linguistic change than a few centuries of isolation would produce.[^SorensonOthers]
- **Lamanite numerical superiority.** The Lamanites are consistently described as "exceedingly more numerous" than the Nephites (Jarom 1:6), despite having begun as the smaller group. Hunter-gatherer societies don't outbreed agricultural ones unless they're absorbing outside populations.[^ScriptureCentralOthers]
- **"Nephite" and "Lamanite" as political labels.** The text uses these terms for political and religious allegiance, not genetics. People "become" Nephites or Lamanites by choice (Alma 3:10–11), which only makes sense if the categories are cultural, not biological.

John L. Sorenson documented these indicators in a landmark 1992 article, concluding that "there were substantial populations in the 'promised land' throughout the period of the Nephite record."[^SorensonOthers] Hugh Nibley made similar arguments as early as 1952.[^NibleyOthers]

These scholars weren't responding to DNA evidence. They were reading the text. The "limited geography" model predates the DNA criticism by decades.

---

### The introduction change was a clarification, not a retreat

The CES Letter frames the 2006 introduction change as a concession to DNA evidence. The timeline doesn't support that.

The phrase "principal ancestors of the American Indians" was never part of the Book of Mormon text. It appeared in the introduction — a summary written by Bruce R. McConkie in 1981, not by Joseph Smith or any ancient author.[^McConkieIntro]

Latter-day Saint scholars had been pushing back on hemispheric readings since the early 1900s:

| Year | Scholar | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1909 | B.H. Roberts | Acknowledged possible Asian migrations via Bering Strait |
| 1921 | Janne M. Sjodahl | Stated the Book of Mormon makes no claim about exclusive ancestry |
| 1929 | Anthony W. Ivins | "Other people came... by other routes and means" |
| 1952 | Hugh Nibley | Book of Mormon peoples "were never the only people on the continent" |
| 1985 | John L. Sorenson | Published *An Ancient American Setting* — the definitive limited geography model |
| 1993 | Dallin H. Oaks | Explained the book describes "a few peoples" among others |

The 2006 change brought the introduction in line with what scholars had been saying for nearly a century. Whether DNA evidence accelerated the revision is irrelevant — the *reading* it corrected was always the minority position among careful students of the text.[^GospelTopicsEssay]

---

### What critics have to explain

The DNA argument, as presented in the CES Letter, depends on the hemispheric model — the idea that Lehi's family were the sole or primary ancestors of all Native Americans. But if you're going to use DNA against the Book of Mormon, you need to grapple with what the science actually says:

- **Why does a 2016 study find zero overlap between 92 ancient and modern South American mitochondrial lineages?** If modern DNA reliably preserves ancient populations, this study should have found continuity. It didn't.[^FehrenSchmitz]
- **Why did the majority of Icelandic founding lineages vanish in just 1,000 years?** If we can't track founders on a small, isolated island with written genealogies, what chance do we have across two continents over 2,600 years?[^HelgasonIceland]
- **Why do Native Americans carry DNA from at least fifteen distinct founding lineages** — with more being discovered regularly? This isn't a single-origin story.[^PeregoStandpoint]
- **How did Polynesian DNA reach South America before Columbus?** A 2020 *Nature* study confirmed pre-Columbian genetic contact between Polynesian and South American populations around AD 1150.[^PolynesianContact] Transoceanic migration happened. The only question is how often.

---

### The Polynesian precedent

That last point deserves its own section.

In 2020, researchers published in *Nature* that populations on Easter Island, the Marquesas, and other Polynesian islands carry DNA from Indigenous South Americans — and the contact dates to approximately AD 1150, centuries before European arrival.[^PolynesianContact]

This matters because critics have historically treated transoceanic migration as implausible. We now have genetic proof that people crossed the Pacific in pre-Columbian times. If Polynesians could reach South America (or vice versa) a thousand years ago, a small group crossing the ocean to the Americas in 600 BC is not the extraordinary claim it's sometimes made out to be.

### The Gospel Topics Essay

In 2014, the Church published "[Book of Mormon and DNA Studies](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng)" as one of its Gospel Topics Essays. The essay is direct about the science:[^GospelTopicsEssay]

- The majority of Native American DNA traces to East Asian origins.
- Founder effect, genetic drift, and population bottlenecks make ancient DNA detection extremely difficult.
- Nothing is known about the DNA of Book of Mormon peoples.
- DNA cannot conclusively prove or disprove the Book of Mormon.

The essay cites the Iceland study, the founder effect, and the post-conquest bottleneck. It also notes that "as much as one-third of Native American DNA" may have originated in Europe or West Asia — a finding from population genetics research showing that ancient Siberians who contributed to Native American ancestry themselves carried Western Eurasian genetic components.[^Raghavan2015]

### What about Haplogroup X?

Some have pointed to mitochondrial haplogroup X2a — found in some North American populations and also present in parts of the Near East and Europe — as possible evidence of ancient Near Eastern migration.

The current scientific consensus is that X2a arrived with other founding lineages via Beringia, not through a separate transoceanic route. Its coalescent age (roughly 12,800 years) predates Book of Mormon chronology by millennia.[^PeregoStandpoint]

This is worth being honest about. Haplogroup X2a is not evidence for the Book of Mormon. Responsible Latter-day Saint geneticists, including Perego, have said as much.[^PeregoStandpoint]

The case for the Book of Mormon's compatibility with DNA evidence doesn't rest on finding a single haplogroup. It rests on the well-documented reality that ancient DNA routinely disappears — and that searching for an unknown genetic profile in a repeatedly bottlenecked population after 2,600 years is not a meaningful scientific test.

---

### The strongest version of the criticism

The most serious version of the DNA objection doesn't come from the CES Letter. It comes from scientists like Simon Southerton, a molecular biologist and former Latter-day Saint bishop, who argues that even under a limited geography model, the Book of Mormon's narrative scope implies populations large enough that some detectable Near Eastern DNA should remain.[^Southerton]

This is a fair challenge. But it still depends on assumptions the evidence doesn't support:

1. That we know what "Near Eastern DNA" from 600 BC looked like.
2. That it would remain detectable after 2,600 years of drift, bottleneck, and admixture.
3. That the post-conquest catastrophe didn't erase it.

The Fehren-Schmitz study answers point 3 decisively. If 92 out of 92 ancient South American lineages are absent from modern populations, the idea that *any* specific ancient lineage should be detectable today is the claim that needs defending — not the reverse.[^FehrenSchmitz]

---

### What the CES Letter doesn't tell you

The DNA section of the CES Letter is two paragraphs long.[^CLDNA] Here's what it leaves out:

| What the CES Letter says | What it doesn't say |
| --- | --- |
| "DNA analysis has concluded that Native American Indians do not originate from the Middle East" | Ancient DNA studies show that lineages routinely vanish entirely — 100% of 92 ancient South American lineages are absent from modern populations |
| The Church changed the Book of Mormon introduction | The change corrected a 1981 summary. Scholars had challenged hemispheric readings since 1909 |
| The Church "conceded" in a 2014 essay | The essay explains foundational population genetics — not a concession |
| (nothing about population size) | Lehi's group of ~20–30 entered a hemisphere of 10–50+ million people |
| (nothing about what Lehi's DNA would look like) | No one knows the DNA profile of a 600 BC Jerusalem family. The test has no baseline |

Two paragraphs. No engagement with population genetics. No mention of genetic drift, founder effect, or bottleneck events. No acknowledgment that the text itself describes other peoples.

That's not a scientific argument. It's a headline.

> **Bottom line:** The DNA argument requires knowing what Lehi's DNA looked like (we don't), assumes it would survive 2,600 years of drift and catastrophic bottleneck events (even Icelandic founding lineages vanish in 1,000 years), and ignores the 90–95% population collapse that erased ancient American lineages wholesale. Two paragraphs of implication. Zero engagement with population genetics.
